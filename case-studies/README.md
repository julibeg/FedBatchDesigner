# Case Studies

The aim of the case studies is to demonstrate how to estimate the parameters required by `FedBatchDesigner` from experimental data.
So far, there are two case studies available:

- L-valine production in _E. coli_ with a microaerobic production stage (using data from [Hao et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.09.007))
- Mevalonic acid production in _E. coli_ with sulfur starvation during the production stage (using data from [Masuda et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.110))

Both include the relevant raw data and a Juptyer notebook performing a least squares fit to estimate the parameters.
Further details can be found in the notebooks.
